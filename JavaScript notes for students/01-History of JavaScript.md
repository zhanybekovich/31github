# History of JavaScript

## History

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in **1995** while he was working at _Netscape Communications Corporation_. Initially named **Mocha**, then quickly changed to **LiveScript**, and finally settling on **JavaScript** due to marketing purposes and its association with the rising popularity of Java.

## Growth and Standardization

In 1996, Microsoft recognized the potential of JavaScript and released its own version called JScript in Internet Explorer. This led to discrepancies in implementations and interpretations of the language between different browsers, leading to compatibility issues. To address this, Netscape submitted JavaScript to **ECMA International** to standardize the language. The result was **ECMAScript**, the standardized specification of the language, which aimed to ensure consistency across different implementations.

**Advancements and Modernization:**
Over the years, **ECMAScript** has undergone numerous revisions and updates, introducing new features, improving performance, and fixing language inconsistencies. Some key versions include:

- ES3 (ECMAScript 3): Released in 1999, it brought significant improvements and is still widely supported today.
- ES5 (ECMAScript 5): Released in 2009, it introduced new methods for arrays and string manipulation, among other enhancements.
- ES6/ES2015: A major milestone, released in 2015, it brought significant changes and introduced many new features like arrow functions, classes, modules, and more.
