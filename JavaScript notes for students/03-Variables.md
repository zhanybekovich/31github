# JavaScript Variables

In JavaScript, variables are fundamental elements used to store and manage data. They act as containers that hold values, allowing developers to manipulate and work with information within a program. Unlike some other programming languages, JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the variable type. This flexibility allows variables to hold different types of data during the execution of a program.

## Declaring Variables

You can declare a variable using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

`var`: Historically used for variable declaration. Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope, depending on where they are declared. However, var has some issues related to hoisting and scope that can lead to unexpected behavior.

`let`: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), it allows block-scoped variables. Variables declared with let are mutable and can be reassigned.

`const`: Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare constants. These variables cannot be reassigned after initialization and are block-scoped.

## Variable Initialization

Variables can be initialized when declared or later in the code:

```javascript
let age = 30; // Initializing 'age' with the value 30
let name; // Declaring 'name' without initialization
name = "John"; // Initializing 'name' later in the code
```

## Naming Conventions

- Variable names can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- They must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
- JavaScript is case-sensitive, so name, Name, and NAME would be considered different variables.
- It's good practice to use meaningful names that reflect the purpose of the variable for better code readability.
