# Operators

In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are fundamental components of the language, allowing you to manipulate and work with data in various ways. JavaScript operators can be categorized into several types, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and more.

## Arithmetic Operators

- (+): Adds two operands.
- (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
- (-): Multiplies two operands.
- (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
- (%): Returns the remainder of the division.

## Comparison Operators

- (==): Checks if two values are equal.
- (===): Checks if two values are equal and of the same type.
- (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
- (!==): Checks if two values are not equal or not of the same type.
- (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
- (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

## Logical Operators

- (&&) Logical AND: Returns true if both operands are true.
- (||) Logical OR: Returns true if at least one operand is true.
- (!)Logical NOT: Returns true if the operand is false and vice versa.

## Assignment Operators

- (=)Assignment: Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
- (+=, -=, \*=, /=): Performs the operation and assigns the result to the left operand
